any model extend elquent can access 

to know if query return collection'get() and all()' data from database use
 $data->isEmpty() or $data->first() or $data->count() and do not use 
!$dat or empty($data) because elequent return object and in poth cases is not empty

$request->only('field1','field2','field3') return array of specified element

note that $request->input('inputFieldName') not work correct with input field type file 
and return empty of this field and to git this field from request use traditional
operation to accesss data from object or use this method $request->hasFile('fieldName')
return true if exist and $request->file('inputFieldName');

to work with session use build in function session()->put('key','value') to add to session
and session()->get('key') to get from session and session()->has('key') to check if exist
in session

RedirectIfAuthenticated middleware redirecte you if authenticated mean redirecte you to
home if authenticated and redirect you to login if not

in oneToOne relationship when return data from two tables must write in with function
foreign key of table that have foreign key and write id of another table
in select statment  in with() or outer with()

$modelObject->makeVisible(['column name']) make hidden column visible in specific method 
that write in it this method and makeHidden(['column name']) the reverse 

->note that max length of varchar = 255

to hidden pivot  tabel that use it to get data set it in hidden

in many to many relationship when get data and use id in condition will display exception
because exist more than id to solve this problem write tableName.id

note that sync() vs attach() in manytomany insertion  sync delete data
 and insert new data this mean that this method make update while attach add row 
 to pivote without deletion

to define constant variable define('PAGINATION_COUNT',2); and can use it in any page'define in route file'

scope mean create function in model this function contain query this query can use it in
any function replace to write query in all function and to use it write name() declare in model like this
forexample( public function scopeCondition();) and to call it condition()

can insert many row in database by insert( ) take array or arrays and return bollean value
but create can not and insert one row and return it

note that min and max mean length in string and in numeric refer to value

only([]) take methods that middleware will run on them

*to make multy authentication download hesto/multi-auth by this command 
     composer require hesto/multi-auth
*to solve this problem make this command
    composer require laravel/helpers
*to instal auth type run this command 
   php artisan multi-auth:install seller -f     will create seller_auth folder of 
   controllers and seller folder of view

 
note that when change in redirectTo property that exist in RegisterController and 
LoginController redirectTo not redirect to value the set to it this because registration
of route file 

when want run specific migration file use this command  
php artisan migrate  --path=database/migrations/2020_09_12_191201_create_brands_table.php

seller =>RedirectifNotSeller will redirect to login if not authenticated
seller.guest =>RedirectifSeller will redirect to home if authenticate


note in relation many to many when make relation in table must us 
 ->withPivot(columns name); where not take array 
and to add timestamps use this 
->withTimestamps();

note that can add pivot in hidden and select specific value from pivot table
or return pivot row 

note that detach(foreginKey) return integer value zero or one

to make validation on array name salary use this case 
->'salary.*'=>'rules' check array data if satisfy this rule
->'salary'=>'rules' check if arrray it self satisfy this rule

to check if array not have repeat value use laravel rule  'distinct'

when set column in validation must be unique and want to except pecific value must
add id or this row like in onlinMarketing->SellerProfileSetting->updateForm()
 
note when make foreach on array of object and return data as key and value 
key will be 0 index and 1 ,2 ,3 and so on but value will by object

if have some data and want store it inside variable use fill() where fill take associative
array

to remove value from request use $request->except([]) take array of input field name
and return array

to move file from directory to anothe use rename(old path and image name and extention,new path and image name and extention)
and return bool value

to remove file use unlink(file name);

note when make save object in session and when return it and want save it in database 
by save() method not save but the update thing was apply on session

note that sync([id=>[]])and syncWithoutDetaching([id=>[]])  take array of associative 
array to insert pivot where id is id of another table and array contain key and value
of column of pivot table  

sync vs syncWithoutDetaching  sync delete data that exist in table and insert data
that want to insert but syncWithoutDetaching add data without deleting table data

to delete row from pivot use detach() and this method take id of another table that 
belong to this relation or can take array of id  and return 0 if not exist and 1 if exist 
and delete it


note that elequent save() method when want save object will save it by id if not exist
will not save it


note that cookie($name,$value,$expir,$domain,...) create cookie object
response($value,$code)->cookie($cookieObject) will add cookie object to response object
when return response cookie object will store in browser and when make any request will
send with request and to get it from request use $request->cookie();


note that all cookie will incrypt in laravle and to except specific cookie open 
App\Meddleware\encreptCookie and add cookies that want to not incrept to $except

note that redirect()->withInput() if give it array will flush it in session and if
not give it any thing will get request data and save this data and it will delete files
from data give in all states

note that browser when send request this request contain cookie and cookie contain cookie data and session id(session file name)
and csrf token that exist inside (session file name) and inside session file if user login will exist authentication code and 
user id 

session()->regenerate() will create new session id(session file) and if cookie session id not exist the session id that exist
in request cookie will change and take session that generated

note that when want visit route and this rout can't visit it before login will save this route in session and to get this route
use redirect()->intended(); will redirect you to your route if not exist intended route will redirect to current route'/'

note when make login the session file will delete and create another session file to declare authentication data and will return 
the session id and csrf token in cookie in response object

to get intended url as string use this  redirect()->intended()->getTargetUrl()

note that login function that exist in Auth not redirect to any thing and void

session()->regenerate($destroy=false) thtis method has destroy = false by default
this mean not destroy data that stor in this session but create new session and save
this data in it and then delete old session


session()->invalidate(); delete session file and the data and then create new session
file
