-> sass is style sheet language that compile to css it allow you create variable and 
   nested rules and function and more
-> normalize library delete margine of body display elements in the best format and 
   make reset of elements 
->when make overlay on element and make hover not make hover because element is under
  overlay to make sense to hover make z-index of element > z-index of overlay
->note that transition add to elemnt not to element when  hover it
->note that z-index set to element that take position absolute,fixed,relative
-> !important add to css property to make this proprty execute if until exist before
-> when set max-width=100% of img this mean that image width is orginal width 
   and not scale up but can scale down
->note that outline override margin mean that outline take space from margin
->1% of the viewport axis. “Viewport” == browser window size == window object.
  If the viewport is 40cm wide, 1vw == 0.4cm. mean 1vw=1% from window size
->note that display:none hidden element and not save its position but visibility:hidden
 hidden element but save its position
->note that position:absolute position value set dependant on ancestor relative element
  and if no ancestor relative element will use body
->Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block
   allows to set a width and height on the element and make margin top and bottom and
   margin auto
->when want make styles on tages expect specific element use this code
  li a:hover:not(.active) where .active is class name of this element
-> note that when make hover on element and this element contain another element 
   and want change property of child element use this code
   .dropdown:hover .dropdown-content
->when element take position:absolute it out fron page flow and will be display:block
  and display:inline-block not has any benefit and container and  will not belong to
  parent element and parent element height will height of not absolute element
->box-sizing:border-box when set width or height of element and add padding or margin
  the width or height not increase
->note that flex-wrap:wrap  the items will wrap when row full and element width will not
  minimize but when flex-wrap:wrap items will minimize 
->note that align item and align-content move the items in direction top and bottom when
  when direction row and left and right when direction column and the key difference 
  that align content تخلي العناصر متساويه من جنب والتفاوت في العرض او الطول تخليه في الناحيه التانيه 
  align content work only when flex-wrap:wrap
->note that position fixed and absolute take element from work flow and make them relate
  to view this mean that element not belong to parent elemnet
->note that when box-sizing:border-box the padding and boreder that will add will 
  discount from element width
->note that box-shadow:(left or right valu) (top or bottom value) blur shadow_length color;
  and left or right and top or botton can be negative value if you want shadow top and right
->note that text-overflow to work must set overflow:hidden and white-space:nowrap
->when element contain another element and make margin of inside element the margin
  not make with inside element and container but make with the element above container
->Why border-radius is not working on element?
  If there are contents within the div that want to set border-radius, you have to set
  overflow: hidden because the child div's overflow can give the impression that 
  the border-radius isn't working
->can not set width and height of inline element
->when want element scrol and stopn when element reach in page top like jumia search header
  set position:sticky; and top:0; to element
->note that overflow:hidden; and  text-overflow:ellipsis; make element content cut when
  reach in element width and sete doted belong the element to know that exist another
  words
->note that can not make margin-bottom of element inside body direct
->note that position absolute depend on nearest element that take position relative and 
  if more than element take position absolute will move relative to the nearest element
  taht take position relative and make layer mean that the last element will display 
  and another not display like in slidebare images
->note that when set top:1% mean 1% from height of the frist parent relative element 
->note that margin:auto; not work with display:inline-block;
->note that when set box-sizing width and height of element is element dimintion mean 
contain any thing inside border and border
->note that display:inline element can not make margin top or bottom and can not make
  padding top or bottom and display:inline block can not make margin:auto
->note that element that display:inline or inline-block can not make text-align:center
->note that exist space between inline-block elements because inlinev and inline-block
  elements treat like text
->note that when element take box shadow and arround it margin box shadow not display
  in aria that around by margin
->when set position:fixed of element the element not belong to parent and move belongs
  to parent
->note that transform scale() not work with inline display
->align-item  and justify-content use to set flex items in middle set them in parent flex
align-item use with flex-direction:row
justify-content use with flex-direction:column
